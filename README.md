# ‚ú® AI Text Summarizer

A free, professional AI-powered text summarization web app built with Streamlit and Hugging Face's Transformers library. This project was created for **Day 53** of the 100 Days of Code challenge, focusing on NLP and Summarization Models.

## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced AI Model**: Utilizes Google's `google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail` model, specifically trained for high-quality news and article summarization.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Clean, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Adjustable Summary Length**: Customize the summary with `min_length` and `max_length` sliders.
- **Real-time Statistics**: See the word count and reduction percentage after summarization.
- **100% Free**: Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud using free-tier resources.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This app is designed for easy, free deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud.

1.  Ensure your code is pushed to a **Public** GitHub repository.
2.  Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/).
3.  Sign in with your GitHub account.
4.  Click "New app", select your repository, branch (`main`), and main file path (`summarizer_app.py`).
5.  Click **"Deploy"**! Your app will have a public URL like `https://ai-text-summarizer.streamlit.app`.

## üß† How It Works

The core functionality uses the `pipeline` API from the ü§ó Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail")
summary = summarizer(original_text, max_length=150, min_length=50)
